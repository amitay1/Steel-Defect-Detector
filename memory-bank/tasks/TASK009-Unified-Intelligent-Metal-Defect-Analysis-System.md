# TASK009 - Unified Intelligent Metal Defect Analysis System

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** June 20, 2025  
**Updated:** June 20, 2025  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Tags:** unified-system, intelligent-analysis, pixel-perfect, astm-compliance, enterprise-reporting

## Original Request
Unify all existing metal defect detection and analysis capabilities into a single, intelligent system that:
- Receives an image and highlights only actual defect areas in yellow with pixel-perfect accuracy.
- Classifies defect types using the trained model, returning a message if the defect is unknown.
- Determines if the image meets international (ASTM E-1932) standards by cross-referencing user-supplied parameters (metal type, thickness, defect type) with a standards table to select the correct reference image (1-8).
- Performs advanced pixel-grid analysis: divides the image into squares, compares defect size in each square to the reference, and fails the image if any square exceeds the standard.
- Generates professional, enterprise-grade reports suitable for industrial use.
- Documents the entire plan and progress in the Memory Bank as a new major task.
