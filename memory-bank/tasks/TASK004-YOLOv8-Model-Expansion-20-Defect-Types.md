# TASK004 - YOLOv8 Model Expansion to 20 Defect Types

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** June 18, 2025  
**Updated:** June 18, 2025  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Tags:** yolov8, training, transfer-learning, model-expansion, completed

## Original Request
Expand the existing YOLOv8 model from detecting 6 defect types to detecting ALL 20 available defect types in the dataset, while maintaining accuracy on the original classes through transfer learning.

## Thought Process
This task represents a critical expansion of the model's capabilities using transfer learning to preserve the quality of the original 6-class detection while adding 14 new defect types. The approach involves:

**Transfer Learning Strategy:**
- Load existing `yolov8_model.pt` (6 classes)
- Expand output layer to 20 classes
- Continue training on comprehensive dataset
- Preserve learned features while adding new capabilities

**Dataset Organization:**
- Organized all 20 defect types into proper YOLO format
- Created `comprehensive_dataset.yaml` with 4,609 total images
- Maintained train/val/test splits for robust evaluation

## Implementation Plan
- [x] 1. Organize comprehensive dataset with all 20 defect types
- [x] 2. Create training configuration for expanded model
- [x] 3. Implement transfer learning script with model expansion
- [x] 4. Launch training with monitoring and progress tracking
- [ ] 5. Validate expanded model performance on all 20 classes
- [ ] 6. Generate comprehensive training report
- [ ] 7. Update main model file with expanded capabilities

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
