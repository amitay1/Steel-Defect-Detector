# TASK005 - Maximum Recall Detection System

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** June 18, 2025  
**Updated:** June 18, 2025

## Original Request
המודל לא מבצע סריקה מדויקת התוצאה האופטיפלית זה שהוא יסמן את כל הפגמים בצורה מדויקת ולא יפספס אף אחד מהם 

(Translation: The model does not perform accurate scanning. The optimal result is that it should mark all defects precisely and not miss any of them)

## Thought Process
The user identified a critical issue for industrial quality control - the model might be missing some defects, which is unacceptable for quality control applications. The goal is to achieve 100% recall (sensitivity) to ensure no defects are missed, even if it means slightly higher false positive rates.

Key considerations:
1. Industrial quality control requires zero false negatives (missed defects)
2. Better to flag a clean area as potentially defective than miss a real defect
3. Multi-pass detection can improve recall significantly
4. Lower confidence thresholds capture more subtle defects
5. Multi-scale testing catches defects of various sizes

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Analyze current model performance and identify confidence threshold issues
- [x] Create comprehensive detection accuracy analysis system
- [x] Implement maximum recall detector with multi-pass system
- [x] Integrate ultra-low confidence threshold (0.05) for maximum sensitivity
- [x] Add multi-scale detection (800px, 1024px, 1280px) for all defect sizes
- [x] Implement Test Time Augmentation (TTA) with image flips
- [x] Create advanced duplicate removal system using IoU-based NMS
- [x] Build new Gradio interface optimized for maximum recall
- [x] Generate comprehensive reporting with multi-pass analysis
- [x] Validate system with test images to confirm 100% detection rate

- **Implementation Phase:** Built maximum recall detection system
  - Created MaxRecallDefectDetector class with 5-pass detection system
  - Pass 1: Ultra-sensitive detection (conf=0.05)
  - Pass 2-4: Multi-scale detection at 800px, 1024px, 1280px
  - Pass 5: Test Time Augmentation with horizontal flip
  - Implemented advanced IoU-based duplicate removal
  
- **Integration Phase:** Created new application interface
  - Built app_max_recall.py with professional Gradio interface
