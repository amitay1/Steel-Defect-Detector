# TASK007 - Ultra-Accurate Reference Card Generator Model

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** June 19, 2025  
**Updated:** June 19, 2025

## Original Request
יצירת מודל נוסף בנוסף למודל הראשי שהתפקיד שלו יהיה אך ורק ליצור כרטיסי השוואה ברמה סופר מדויקת, עם גישה לתיקיות האימון של כל הפגמים ואפשרות להתאמן כדי לייצר את הכרטיסים ברמה גבוהה.

Translation: Create an additional model alongside the main model whose role will be solely to create comparison cards at a super-accurate level, with access to the training folders of all defects and the ability to train to generate the cards at a high level.

## Thought Process
The user requested a specialized AI model dedicated exclusively to generating ultra-accurate reference comparison cards. This required creating a completely separate system that could:

1. **Access Training Data**: Direct access to all defect image folders for learning
2. **Visual Analysis**: Advanced computer vision techniques to extract visual characteristics
3. **Pattern Learning**: Machine learning to identify dominant patterns for each defect type
4. **Professional Generation**: Create industrial-grade reference cards matching real defects
5. **8-Slot Comparison Cards**: Generate professional comparison layouts
6. **Quality Validation**: Comprehensive quality assurance and validation

The approach involved creating three main components:
- **Core Model** (`reference_card_generator_model.py`): The specialized AI model with advanced visual analysis
- **Training Framework** (`reference_card_trainer.py`): Comprehensive training and deployment system
- **Complete System** (`ultra_accurate_reference_system.py`): Unified interface with GUI and CLI
