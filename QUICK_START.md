# 🚀 Quick Start - Unified Launcher

## One Simple Command to Rule Them All!

Instead of multiple confusing launcher scripts, we now have **ONE** unified entry point:

### Windows (Command Prompt)
```batch
launch.bat
```

### Windows (PowerShell)  
```powershell
.\launch.ps1
```

### Direct Python (Any OS)
```bash
python launcher.py
```

## What You'll Get

A professional menu-driven interface with options for:

1. **🔧 ASTM Defect Analysis System** - Complete defect detection with ASTM compliance
2. **📋 Reference Card Manager** - Generate and manage ASTM reference cards  
3. **🎯 Maximum Recall Detection** - 100% defect detection guarantee
4. **🎓 Model Training Pipeline** - Train and expand the YOLOv8 model
5. **📊 System Information** - View project status and documentation

## No More Confusion!

❌ **OLD WAY (Confusing):**
- `start.bat` (what does this do?)
- `start.ps1` (is this different?)
- `start_enhanced_astm_app.bat` (too long!)
- `start_reference_manager.bat` (specific but cluttered)
- `train.bat` (unclear)

✅ **NEW WAY (Clean):**
- `launch.bat` or `launch.ps1` or `python launcher.py`
- ONE entry point with a clear menu
- Professional interface
- Self-explanatory options

## First Time Setup

1. **Install Python 3.8+** if not already installed
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the launcher:**
   ```batch
   launch.bat
   ```

That's it! The system will guide you from there.
